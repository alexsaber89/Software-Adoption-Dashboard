# Software Adoption Dashboard

## Description
This project aims to solve a real-world business case I encountered with a previous employer, utilizing Angular Charts for data visualization.
## Features
* Tracks client companies where the user has pitched a new software offering
* Tracks customer company’s email domain (i.e. “@bestbuy.com”)
* Compares the companies the user has pitched to a constantly updating list of all Active Users of the software
* As more people sign up, the user will get credit if the registrant works at a company the user pitched
* Returns the number of Active Users, per company pitched
* The user's performance is measured against an individual quota and other sales reps in the company
* Future version of project will retrieve Active Users from a separate API
